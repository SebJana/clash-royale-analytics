"""Worker pool that continuously processes due players from the schedules.

Each worker claims one due player, runs its job, and acknowledges it with the
delay until the player is due again. There is no batch cycle: players are
processed whenever they become due, and a slow or failing player only delays
itself.

Battle syncs take priority because a late battle sync can lose battles for
good, while a late profile is only stale. Profiles run when no battle sync is
due, or, on one worker, once they are overdue by more than PROFILE_MAX_LATENESS.
