"""Per-player scraping schedule shared by the data scraper and the API.

Each schedule is one Redis sorted set: member = player tag, score = the time
(epoch ms) at which the player is due. A sorted set holds every member at most
once, so a player can never be queued twice and the schedule can never grow
past the number of tracked players. When workers fall behind, players become
late instead of the queue growing.

A claim moves the player's score to the end of the claim TTL and records an
owner token. If the worker dies, the claim simply expires and the player is
due again, without a separate recovery path. An ack only applies while the
owner still matches, so a late ack cannot overwrite a newer claim.

MongoDB stays the source of truth for which players are tracked. The schedule
can be rebuilt from it at any time (see the scraper's reconciler), so losing
this Redis data only delays scraping until the next reconciliation.
